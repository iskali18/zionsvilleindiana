    <h1>Downtown Zionsville</h1>
    <p class="page-intro">
      Brick streets, local shops, cozy cafés, and an unhurried pace — downtown Zionsville is a place to slow down.
      Whether you have an hour or an evening, it’s easy to wander, explore, and enjoy the small moments that make the village feel special.

    <h2>Ways to spend an afternoon or evening</h2>
    <p class="muted">
      Downtown Zionsville invites you to slow down. Here are a few easy ways people tend to spend time —
      mix, match, or take your own route.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="container two-col">

    <!-- Daytime family -->
    <div class="card">
      <h3>A daytime outing with family</h3>
      <p>
        Downtown works especially well during the day, when it’s easy to combine food, fresh air,
        and a little wandering without feeling rushed.
      </p>
      <ul class="bullets">
        <li>Start with breakfast or brunch at Rosie’s Place, a longtime local favorite.</li>
        <li>Spend time at Lions Park, with playgrounds and an easy walking trail.</li>
        <li>Continue into the adjacent Creekside Nature Park for a quieter loop and a change of scenery.</li>
        <li>Wrap up with a stroll along Main Street and ice cream at The Scoop.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="muted">
        <strong>Good to know:</strong> Rosie’s Place and most cafés close early, making this an ideal
        morning or early-afternoon plan.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Elevated evening -->
    <div class="card">
      <h3>An easy, elevated evening</h3>
      <p>
        Evenings downtown are relaxed and welcoming — more about conversation and atmosphere
        than checking off a list.
      </p>
      <ul class="bullets">
        <li>Enjoy dinner at Noah Grant’s, Convivio Italian Artisan Cuisine, or Cobblestone.</li>
        <li>Take a slow walk along Main Street and browse the storefronts.</li>
        <li>Finish with dessert or ice cream at The Scoop, which often stays open into the evening.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="muted">
        <strong>Local tip:</strong> Downtown shines at dusk, when the brick streets and shop windows
        set the tone for an unhurried night.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Afternoon wander -->
    <div class="card">
      <h3>A relaxed afternoon wander</h3>
      <p>
        Some of the best time downtown is spent simply wandering — with a warm drink,
        a few shops, and no set agenda.
      </p>
      <ul class="bullets">
        <li>Grab coffee or a light bite at Our Place Coffee or Roasted in the Village.</li>
        <li>Browse locally owned shops along Main Street.</li>
        <li>Stop by Truffles & Creams Chocolatier for a small treat before they close.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="muted">
        <strong>Timing note:</strong> Most cafés and chocolate shops close by mid-afternoon,
        making this a perfect daytime plan.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Discovery -->
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Discovery mode</h3>
      <p>
        Downtown Zionsville rewards curiosity. A slower pace makes it easy to notice
        the details that give the village its character.
      </p>
      <ul class="bullets">
        <li>Explore side streets and look for historic architecture and seasonal décor.</li>
        <li>Duck into shops you haven’t visited before.</li>
        <li>Bring a camera — brick streets and storefronts change with the seasons.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="muted">
        <strong>Worth discovering:</strong> artisan sourdough and fresh-baked breads at The Baker’s House,
        and Angelo’s Italian Market for deli items and specialty foods to take home.
